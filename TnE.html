        <div class="Name"> Dr. Steve Brule</div>
        <div class="Desc"> Steve got his start doing guest segments called "For Your Health" on the channel 5 news. He has parlayed that success into his own show, "Check it Out w/ Dr. Steve Brule". In general, he is not a fan of "hunks". He is, however, a fan of sweet-berry wine as evidenced by his appearance on the channel 5 news segment where he had a bit too much and made a pass at Jan. He remains full of all sorts of useful tips expanding vastly beyond your health, proving that the Dr is master of more than just medicine. </div>
