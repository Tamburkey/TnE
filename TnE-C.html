              Steve got his start doing guest segments called "For Your Health" on the channel 5 news. He has parlayed that success into his own show, "Check it Out w/ Dr. Steve Brule". In general, he is not a fan of "hunks". He is, however, a fan of sweet-berry wine as evidenced by his appearance on the channel 5 news segment where he had a bit too much and made a pass at Jan. He remains full of all sorts of useful tips expanding vastly beyond your health, proving that the Dr is master of more than just medicine.

            One half of the married news team on channel 5. Stay out of her spaghetti house. It gets really nasty in there. She may or may not have an extra-marital relationship with Dr. Steven Brule although it is difficult to tell. She is allergic to red wine.

            One half of the married news team on channel 5. He doesn't really like apples but he is still strong as a horse. Dead. Or is he?
